# RED-WINE-QUALITY-PREDICTION
The Red Wine Quality Prediction project uses machine learning to estimate wine quality from physicochemical features. A Random Forest model is trained on the UCI dataset, saved, and deployed through a Streamlit UI. Users input wine attributes, and the system instantly predicts a quality score.
